<title>tower poem</title>

<body> 

I read a chapbook of a 
woman; now sheets 
and legs are wet; that 
book didn’t teach me
how to clean it up; I 
threw a carafe of my piss
over the roof; I never
called ‘Heyo’; I can 
hear everyone below
in the library; they are
guarding my sounds and 
keep checking I don’t 
sunburn my tits anymore. 
No they aren’t but I’m 
taking care and doing it 
myself; I could wash 
the sheets before dinner
and after go outside. 
<br>
<br>
Dinner was on the porch; 
it was oiled Mexican 
dinner you worry about
the fats and meats and 
can’t taste it anymore;
the porch is lower than 
all the flower pots and 
a round statue of a sitting
man in ecstasy he made;
small walls push up 
around and keep the dirt 
like walls; porches don’t 
need blue ceilings here; 
they can crash in on 
their own blueprint and 
make it out ok; It’s all a
mess I think; two men
both fucked architects
and only one ended 
up dead; heart attack; 
gets herself up and 
walks to a bench. its 
three steps down to 
the porch from the 
flower pots and round
statue of a sitting man;
I am watching my weight 
while she picks a banjo 
and grinds air around her 
with her hair tucked 
behind each ear; her foot 
supine on my plate
paralleling my fork.
