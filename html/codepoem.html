<body> 
<div> 
<p>I read a chapbook of a<br>
woman; now sheets<br>
and legs are wet; that<br> 
book didn’t teach me<br>
how to clean it up; I <br>
threw a carafe of my piss<br>
over the roof; I never<br>
called ‘Heyo’; I can <br>
hear everyone below<br>
in the library; they are<br>
guarding my sounds and <br>
keep checking I don’t <br>
sunburn my tits anymore. <br>
No they aren’t but I’m <br>
taking care and doing it <br>
myself; I could wash <br>
the sheets before dinner<br>
and after go outside. <br>
<br>
<br>
Dinner was on the porch; <br>
it was oiled Mexican <br>
dinner you worry about<br>
the fats and meats and <br>
can’t taste it anymore;<br>
the porch is lower than <br>
all the flower pots and <br>
a round statue of a sitting<br>
man in ecstasy he made;<br>
small walls push up <br>
around and keep the dirt <br>
like walls; porches don’t <br>
need blue ceilings here; <br>
they can crash in on <br>
their own blueprint and <br>
make it out ok; It’s all a<br>
mess I think; two men<br>
both fucked architects<br>
and only one ended <br>
up dead; heart attack; <br>
gets herself up and <br>
walks to a bench. its <br>
three steps down to <br>
the porch from the <br>
flower pots and round<br>
statue of a sitting man;<br>
I am watching my weight <br>
while she picks a banjo <br>
and grinds air around her <br>
with her hair tucked <br>
behind each ear; her foot <br>
supine on my plate<br>
paralleling my fork.<br>
