<p style="color: #4B0082;">This is me as a young kid. This photo is a screen shot of a photo of a printed photo originally taken on a digital camera, but then scanned onto a computer. I found if I moved my face around enough as a kid, I wouldn't have to actually be anybody. I had a birthday party when I turned seven where each one of my family members dressed up like a fairy or wizard or what-have-you and placed themselves in the woods at my house and I walked around dressed as a fairy with my fairy friends and we played magical games and made wands and fairy houses and music out of the rocks and brush and flowers in the woods and drowned our fairy boats in my waterfall. After that I learned that Percy Shelley had an affinity for drowning paper boats during his short career at Oxford at the turn of the 19th century. It only made drowning things in water more appealing and I feared I was attempting to curate an artist-ethos around the mutual action. I haven't drowned anything since but I'm sure there are loads of famous people who eat and shit and scratch their lips just as I do so I guess its just something to get over.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:helvetia;"> This is a picture of one of my prom dates who made it to fashion week!! During prom he got on stage and put both of his feet behind his head and spun around on his butt while the cotton-eye-joe played </h2>
<p font color="red"> I have so many favorite things. One thing I like so much is bananas. I recently went to the grocers and bought a fourty-pound box of bananas and ate ~25 a day until they were too spotted and then I peeled each of those 'nanners and threw them in the freezer. Now I blend my bananas in my VitaMix blender and make banana ice cream nearly every day.</p>

<p style="font-family:helvetica;">This is a carrot I ate yesterday that looked like a pregnancy test. It was negative and the carrot tasted so so good.</p>

My <a href="https://www.facebook.com/simondebevoise?fref=ts">friend</a> hurt his foot playing squash yesterday and now has a limp but I think he's faking a little.
