<h2 <style="font-family:helvetia;"> <style="color;red;"> This is a picture of one of my prom dates who made it to fashion week!! During prom he got on stage and put both of his feet behind his head and spun around on his butt while the cotton-eye-joe played </style></h2>

<p <font color="red"> I have so many favorite things. One thing I like so much is bananas. I recently went to the grocers and bought a fourty-pound box of bananas and ate ~25 a day until they were too spotted and then I peeled each of those 'nanners and threw them in the freezer. Now I blend my bananas in my VitaMix blender and make banana ice cream nearly every day.</p>
